This is an all text based maze in the style of Colossal Cave Adventure. 

To run the game, simply complile each progam with gcc. Buildrooms will generate a new folder in the current
working directory with a random path comprised of 7 rooms. Running Adventure will allow the user to navigate the
most recently created Buildrooms folder. The game also employs mutex threads to allow the user to view the current 
system time by typing "time" while Adventure is running.
